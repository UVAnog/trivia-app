# trivia-app
Trivia App built using React Native and React JS using the open trivia database which can be found here: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php There are 10 questions asked with 4 potential answers for each one, unless in the case of true / false questions. I hope to add the ability to choose category and quantity of questions.

After getting the functionality of the questions, and correct / incorrect answers I used CSS to style the trivia app. The screenshots below are pulled from live trivia app play.
